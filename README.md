# ModPatcher
ModPatcher is for set the 16/9 flag in MOD-video files (recorded with my Panasonic video camera).
It searches recursively beginning from a roo-folder all files with configured extension and set the flag within the file.

First commit:
I have lost my local source code, so I had restored it with ILSpy from my last executable version.
